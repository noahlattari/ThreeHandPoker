To run this program, please type ./run_tests "python3 game.py". 

The tests ran for me and succeeded with both the given inputs. I understand there is a separate run_tests3 file for python3, but it kept throwing errors, for some reason the other run_tests worked instead even though this was coded in python3.

For manual entry please run: 
"python3 game.py

0 Kh 4d 3c
1 Jd 5c 7s
2 9s 3h 2d"

Thank you for giving me this opportunity! Python isn't my main language I'm best with but figured this would be a good learning experience.
